# macOS-Mail-Header-Grabber
A bit of AppleScript that grabs headers from all messages in a selected mailbox, and stores them in a single CSV file. 


Initial commit published (good break for a few hrs). Exports to a CSV in a very unsorted way, but still gets the job done. Documentation and refinements to come.
